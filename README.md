# BraTS-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-with-3D-UNet
The MICCAI BRATS challenge provides a rich dataset for training machine learning algorithms for brain tumor segmentation tasks. This dataset will help in learning the fundamentals of magnetic resonance imaging processing and implementation as well as in the creation of a neural network for tumor segmentation using deep learning techniques.
